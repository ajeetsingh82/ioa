      User query: '{query}'

      Context:
      {context}

      STRICT OUTPUT PROTOCOL:
      1. Return ONLY a raw JSON object.
      2. The object must have a single key "answer".
      3. The "answer" value must be PLAIN TEXT.
      4. NO Markdown in the answer. NO headings. NO bullet points.
      5. NO code fences around the JSON.
      6. Violation of this protocol is a system failure.

      Example:
      {{"answer": "This is the synthesized answer in plain text."}}
